                <p class="body-text">&emsp;After convincing my parents to buy me a QBasic programming book in third grade, I was off to the races. Initially, I was self-taught, until I was afforded the luxury of attending The Walker School in Marietta to then graduate from. Upon my enrollment, they also began offering a Computer Science course for the first time ever. Dr Vesey was influential to me beyond what she even knows to this day, and she helped me learn Pascal, C++, and Java back in 1997. Regardless of where I have been in life, computers have been right by my side.  I'm into professional gaming (eSports), game development, the Internet-of-things, drones, and finding new ways to pack technology into sports cars.</p>
